// Let's start making them and serving our guests!
// 3. create an empty array called 'orders'


// 4. We're going to serve one customer at a time. What is the name of the first customer?
// Print out, "Now serving {customer name here}"



// 5. How many tacos did they order? Print out, "they ordered {number of tacos} tacos"


// 6. Add all the names of the tacos in their order to the 'orders' array from step 3.



// 7. Add your own order to the customers array, with your name and your taco orders.


// 8. Serve the tacos! pop() one taco at a time out of the orders array, and print out "serving {name of taco}"

// 9. The chef is asking you what the last taco you made was. Print out the last item of the last customer's order. "The last customer ordered {name of taco}"


// BONUS QUESTIONS:
// 10. At the end of the day, the chef asks you the total # of tacos you made today. Print out, "Chef, I made {number of tacos} tacos today"


// 11. Write a loop to do tasks 4-6 for every customer, instead of writing it out over and over.
